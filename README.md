## Unsupervised Spoken Constituency Parsing

Official repo for our ICASSP 2023 paper: [Cascading and Direct Approaches to Unsupervised Constituency Parsing on Spoken Sentences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08809), which investigates two approaches to unsupervised constituency parsing on spoken sentences, given 1) raw speech & 2) unlabeled text.
